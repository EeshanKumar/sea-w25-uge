Tons of versions of Unix/Linux/GNU anything/BSD - lots of per-platform problems and solutions

Linux: unix-like core of OSs like Android and Ubuntu
Darwin: unix-like core of OSX and iOS

4 common dev-friendly traits of all Unix systems:
-Nearly all data is stored as plaintext file
-Nested Subdirectories
-Many small programs
-I/O redirection (input not necessarily keyboard, output not necessarily screen)

Those things add up to the Unix philosophy: a set of best practices used when coding for it.

Unix Kernel
a program whose job is to manage the hardware. If any program wants permission to use the hardware, they have to go through the Kernel.




It’s safe from Hackers (that’s why you have to enter password).

Drivers are plugins for the Kernel - that’s why there’s so much password entry.


Unix Shell
a program whose job it is to provide a user interface to the kernel. Command Line user interface.
The shell prevents the user from accessing the kernel. Also helps crashes.

REPL: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop

[installed git, configured shell and CL per online lesson instructions in https://github.com/codefellows/sea-w25-uge]

Home directory: a folder on the computer that belongs to you. Figure out by “pwd” (“print working directory”).
Path is a location in your filesystem. General to specific.

A path is absolute when it starts with a /.
A path is relative when id doesn't.

cd X to change directory. Path can be absolute or relative.
pwd = /Users/michaelhazani




cmd+k = clean screen
cd = home directory
cd ~ = same
cd / = changed directories to the root. Cannot go any higher.
Generally restricted to admins.
ls can have modifiers (one or more after dash.)
.. - up one
. - current dir
~ - home
-t = tweaked (by modification time)
-l = long format
-r = reverse ordering
-R = recursively shows every file on the computer.
man = manual.
\ backwards slash is an escape character instead of space. You can also add in quotes.
Ctrl+C kills processes!

ll = long list
la - list ALL

HIstory = all your commands ever in reverse order
less = useful pager program, control movement through reading
sort = alphabetically

The pipe | letter can output the output of one command to the input of another.

history > moving_around.txt would output history to a file called that (called “redirection”).
> is destructive, >> appends (adds).


To open/read files:
cat XXXX - concatenate / READ files!
nano XXXXX - internal text editor (ctrl+X to quit)
sublime XXXXXX - opens it in sublime (because you set it up)
less XXXXXXX - will show in the console one page at a time
