Learned a ton of stuff about git from the pre-study videos which were great. Since my own personal challenge to myself is to finish the assignment before the class ends, I don't know what you've taught about it yet, but I'm sure it'll be great and full of enlightening info - it certainly has been so far. Thanks for a great class! Can't wait for my next Code Fellows sesh!
