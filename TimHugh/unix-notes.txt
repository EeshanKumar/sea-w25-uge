WHY UNIX

History of UNIX
  Unix developers:
    Ken Thompson, Dennis Richie
    Bell research labs in 60's

  Released in 1973
  BSD = Berkeley Software Distribution
    Mac OS derived from NextStep, a fork of BSD
    iOS also runs on Darwin

  4 common traits that make unix developer friendly:
    - nearly all data is stored in human-readable plaintext
    - nested subdirectories
      in the 60's, many OSes only allowed one level of subdirectories
    - made up of many small programs
    - input/output redirection

  Unix shell named due to it's similarity to a turtle shell (protecting the
      kernel from the outside world)

  REPL = read, evaluate, print, loop

  New bash tricks:
    ctrl + u        clear current line
    ls -S           sort by size
    ls -t           sort by modified time
    ls -r           reverse list

  man just pipes shit into less
    - you can see this by opening help in man
