New commands I learned:

pwd - "print working directory" - shows directory I'm in right now

history - shows the history of terminal commands in order from newest at top and oldest at bottom
  -r flag shows the list in reverse order
  | "pipe" symbol redirects output of left call into input of right call
  > pushes output of left call into file on the right.  If no such file exists a new one is created.
    if the file does exist it is overwritten.
  >> pushes output of left call into file on the right.  If no such file exists a new one is created.
    if the file does exist the values are appended to the file.

ls - lists contents of directory
  -l shows things in long format

less - a paging system, where output is shown one page at a time.  "q" to quit.  Up and down arrows to scroll.
cat - concatenates contents of two files and ouputs the results to the screen.
clear - clears the terminal

cd - change directory
  . is the current directory
  .. goes up one directory
  / goes to the root directory
  ~ goes to the home directory (cd on its own does this too)

mv - moves a file/directory and/or renames them.
