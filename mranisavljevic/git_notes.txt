New commands I learned:

git init - initializes the repository for git tracking
git status - shows the status of the files in the repository staging area
git add <file> - adds the named file into the staging area
git commit - commits changes added to the staging area
  -m "note" - while commiting you have to add a message to explain what the commit is meant to do.
git branch - shows the current branch
git branch <name> - creates a new branch with the specified name
  -d - to delete branch
git checkout <name> - moves you to the specified branch
git log - shows log of commits
git ll - shows condensed, single-row version of the log
git la - shows detail of what changed in the commit
git remote add origin <url> - points the repo to the remote url (on github)
git push - pushes recent commits to github (ones that aren't already on github)
git merge - merges one branch into another
git pull - pulls commits from github onto local machine
git clone - clones fork/repo onto desktop
